            <p>Hey, my name is Jonathan â€” I would call myself a front-end software engineer (you know those job titles). I am currently living in Berlin, Germany, working full-time as a Software Engineer at eBay Classifieds Group, where I mainly concentrate on programming with JavaScript based software architecture embedded in a micro-service oriented landscape. Agile development with Kanban or Scrum influence my daily work since 2010.</p>
            <p>
              I am a passionate web developer, believing in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix philosophy</a> form- and function-wise. I love effective and fast user interfaces that bring real value to people. I appreciate logical, user-centered design approaches. Therefore I strive to use technologies and
              methodologies that deliver the best possible user experience, trying to concentrate on simple, focused and concise development.</p>
            <p>Besides that I love nature, obsessed with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jonykrause/">riding motorbikes</a> and enjoy people that take themselves not too seriously.</p>
            <p>This is version three of my website. You can also have a look back at<a href="http://v1.jonathan-krause.de/"> version one</a> and<a href="http://v2.jonathan-krause.de/"> version two</a>, if interested. With version three I forced myself to write
              English to improve my language skills. So there are german as well as english posts on this blog.</p>
            <p>Feel free to<a href="http://twitter.com/?status=%20@jonykrause%20"> send me a tweet</a> or just<a href="mailto:jony@jonathan-krause.de"> drop me an email</a> whenever you want. You can find me also on<a href="https://github.com/jonykrause"> Github</a> and
